/**
 * Regression: the bundled CC template must always carry the config-scoped tools
 * (TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, TaskUpdate).
 *
 * Bug (2026-08-15, auto-rebake PR #984): CC's REMOTE config — not its version,
 * and not the headless capture mode — decides whether it advertises these. The
 * 2026-08-11 bake on CC v2.1.232 captured all four; the 2026-08-15 bake on
 * v2.1.233 captured none of them, while TaskOutput and TaskStop (the rest of the
 * task subsystem) stayed put. The auto-rebake therefore proposed dropping four
 * tools from src/cc-template-data.json.
 *
 * Why that is a regression and not a faithful capture: CC_NATIVE_NAMES_UNION is
 * derived from the bundle, and buildCCRequest identity-maps only names in that
 * set. Drop TaskCreate and a CC client that still declares it falls into the
 * unmapped round-robin — renamed onto a fallback slot with junk args, which is
 * exactly the v4.8.93 failure mode. The reverse is inert: advertise is the
 * INTERSECTION of the bundle with the client's declared tools, so a bundle entry
 * no client declares is never sent upstream.
 *
 * Fix: CONFIG_SCOPED_TOOLS in src/cc-template.ts + a preservation merge in
 * scripts/capture-and-bake.mjs, mirroring PLATFORM_ONLY_TOOLS and
 * INTERACTIVE_ONLY_TOOLS. This test guards the resulting invariant so a future
 * config-scoped capture (or a manual edit) can't silently re-drop them.
 *
 * In-process — no proxy / OAuth / upstream.
