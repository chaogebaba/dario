> ## 🎉 dario `v5.0` — one request path, one credential model
>
> v5 is a **breaking simplification**: two removals, zero feature pile-on.
>
> - **🏊 Pool-as-primitive.** Every dario is now a *pool*. A plain `dario login` is a pool of one; add a second Claude seat and the same `localhost:3456` load-balances across them by live headroom — no mode switch, no config flag.
> - **🧹 Shim mode removed.** The deprecated shim transport is gone. Proxy mode rebuilds every request to Claude Code's wire shape and is strictly better for every client.
>
> **Upgrading from v4?** Solo `dario login` + `dario proxy` users: nothing to do. Full notes → **[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)** · [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#500---2026-07-11)

You're already paying $20, $100, or $200 a month for Claude. Then Cursor wants an API key. Aider wants an API key. Cline, Continue, Zed, your scripts — every one of them bills you **again**, per token, while the subscription you already bought sits idle in Claude Code.

**dario is one local endpoint that routes all of them through the Claude subscription you already pay for.** Point any Anthropic- or OpenAI-compatible tool at `http://localhost:3456` and you're done. No per-tool config, no second bill.

```bash
# 1. Install
bun add --global @askalf/dario

# 2. Log in to your Claude subscription (Pro, Max 5x, or Max 20x)
dario login                 # or `dario login --manual` for SSH / headless

# 3. Start the local proxy
dario proxy                 # separate terminal or background

# 4. Point any Anthropic-compat tool at it
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dario
```

That's the whole setup. Every tool that honors those env vars now runs on your subscription.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Cline, Roo Code, Continue.dev, Zed, Windsurf, OpenHands, OpenClaw, Hermes, Codex CLI, the [Claude Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk), your own scripts.

Add other providers and reuse the same proxy:

```bash
dario backend add openai     --key=sk-proj-...
dario backend add groq       --key=gsk_...    --base-url=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
dario backend add openrouter --key=sk-or-...  --base-url=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
dario backend add local      --key=anything   --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1

export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=dario
```

Force a specific backend with a model prefix: `openai:gpt-4o`, `claude:opus`, `groq:llama-3.3-70b`, `local:qwen-coder`. Prefer Docker? `ghcr.io/askalf/dario:latest` — multi-arch (`amd64`+`arm64`), published every release ([guide](./docs/docker.md)). Something off? `dario doctor` prints one paste-ready health report.

### The interactive TUI

Type `dario` with no args (in another terminal) for a full-screen control panel — live request stream, per-model burn-rate, rate-limit utilization, billing-bucket breakdown, and an in-place config editor that writes to `~/.dario/config.json`. Subscription accounting you watch happen instead of reading out of log files. Pure ANSI, zero new runtime deps.

## The money

| Setup | Monthly cost — heavy user |
|---|---|
| Cursor + Anthropic API direct | **$80–$300** |
| Multi-tool heavy use (Cursor + Aider + Cline + Continue), per-token | **$200–$600+** |
| **Any of the above + dario** | **$20–$200 flat** — your existing Pro/Max plan, nothing extra |

One subscription, every tool. Switching providers is a model-name change, not a reconfigure — add a backend once and the same `localhost:3456` speaks OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, or a local Ollama too.

---

## What it routes

You point every tool at one URL. dario reads each request, decides which backend owns it, and forwards it in that backend's native protocol.

| Client speaks | Model | Routes to | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Messages | `claude-*` / `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` | Claude backend | OAuth swap + CC template → `api.anthropic.com` |
| Anthropic Messages | `gpt-*`, `llama-*`, … | OpenAI-compat backend | Anthropic→OpenAI translation, forwarded |
| OpenAI Chat | `gpt-*` / `o1-*` / `o3-*` | OpenAI-compat backend | Auth swap, body forwarded byte-for-byte |
| OpenAI Chat | `claude-*` | Claude backend | OpenAI→Anthropic translation, then Claude path |
| Either | `<provider>:<model>` | Forced by prefix | Explicit override |

The tool doesn't know. The backend doesn't know. dario is the seam.

**The full Claude lineup, autodetected.** Fable 5, Opus 5, Sonnet 5, and Haiku 4.5 — plus `[1m]` long-context variants on every family except haiku — by full id (`claude-opus-5`) or shortcut (`fable` / `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`, append `1m` for the long-context form; `opus48` / `opus47` / `opus46` / `sonnet46` pin a specific generation and never float). `GET /v1/models` reads Anthropic's live catalog (TTL-cached, baked fallback when offline), so a new model resolves the day it lands with no dario release, and the model-specific request shape is applied automatically. The TUI's Status tab lists whatever the catalog currently advertises, so it tracks the same set without a release either. Families pulled upstream are filtered from both the live catalog and the fallback so `/v1/models` never advertises a model that 404s — reversible via `DARIO_SUSPENDED_MODELS` if a family is ever pulled again.

---

## Multi-account pool

**In v5 every dario is a pool** — a plain `dario login` is a pool of one, no separate mode to switch on. One Claude subscription has a ceiling; hold more than one seat — a personal Max and a work Max, a couple of Pros, team seats — and the same `localhost:3456` routes every request to whichever seat has the most headroom, live, per request. A single `dario accounts add` even bootstraps a servable proxy with no `dario login` step:

```bash
dario accounts add work
dario accounts add personal
dario proxy
```

Three things it does that a round-robin doesn't:

- **Per-model headroom routing.** Anthropic meters each model family separately — a `5h` bucket, a `7d` bucket, and a per-model `7d_<family>` bucket. dario reads all of them off every response and routes each request by the bucket that governs it: an Opus call to the seat with Opus room, a Sonnet call to the seat with Sonnet room, independently. Plan tiers mix freely — dario cares about headroom, not tier.
- **Session stickiness.** Claude's prompt cache is scoped to `{account × cache key}`, so rotating a long conversation across seats on headroom alone re-pays cache-create every turn — a **5–10× token-cost multiplier** on the cached portion. dario uses explicit session/body identifiers when available and falls back to a deterministic first-turn hash; bindings are model-scoped and rebind only when that account is unavailable.
- **In-flight 429 failover.** A seat hits its wall mid-request and dario retries the *same request* against the next-best account before your client ever sees an error. The sticky binding follows to the new seat, so the next turn doesn't re-select the cold one.

## Overage guard

During normal operation, a subscriber should never see a single response billed outside their subscription pool. If one is, something is wrong — wire-shape drift, an account misconfig, a change upstream — and forwarding more requests in the same shape either bleeds real money (accounts with extra-usage enabled) or returns a wall of rejections. The first hit is the signal; the rest are damage.

So the moment any upstream response bills to something other than your subscription pool, dario **halts the proxy**. The check is an allow-list, not a match on one string: anything that isn't a known subscription claim (`five_hour` / `seven_day` and their fallbacks) and isn't the `unknown` no-header sentinel trips it — so a billing bucket dario has never seen still halts. Subsequent requests return `503` with an Anthropic-shaped error body until you run `dario resume`, press `R` in the TUI, or the cooldown clears (default 30 min). The halt shows across the TUI, fires a best-effort OS notification, and emits named SSE events. Tune it via `~/.dario/config.json` → `overageGuard` or `--overage-behavior=warn` / `--no-overage-guard` / `--overage-cooldown=<ms>`. (In upstream-API-key passthrough mode — `ANTHROPIC_UPSTREAM_API_KEY` — the guard is off; `api` billing is the point there.) Verified end-to-end by [`test/overage-guard-e2e-live.mjs`](./test/overage-guard-e2e-live.mjs). Background: [#288](https://github.com/askalf/dario/issues/288).

---

## Voice dictation

Claude Code's `/voice` opens a WebSocket to `/api/ws/speech_to_text/voice_stream`. It does **not** build that URL from `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. It builds it from CC's OAuth config, which is hardcoded to `api.anthropic.com` and overridable only against a first-party allowlist dario is not on. So voice behind dario has never been broken — it bypasses dario entirely, and the socket carries your own OAuth access token straight off the box, which is the one credential the rest of your setup routes through the proxy to avoid exposing.

One environment variable redirects it. CC reads it verbatim, with no allowlist:

```sh
VOICE_STREAM_BASE_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:3456 claude
```

dario answers the upgrade, swaps the `Authorization` header for a pool token, dials Anthropic, and relays bytes. It never parses a frame, so compression, fragmentation and any future frame type pass through untouched — and dario sees no transcripts, no audio, no usage. The socket gets a log line at close and nothing else.

Two gates stay on CC's side and dario cannot move them:

- **Voice is unavailable when CC resolves its credentials from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or an `apiKeyHelper`.** Anthropic's own docs say the same. If that's your setup, `/voice` is off before dario is involved — use `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` instead, and note that CC will then hold two different credentials at once (dario's key for inference, its own OAuth token for the voice handshake).
- **`allow_voice_mode` is a remote gate.** It can be off for your account for reasons neither CC nor dario controls.

Two more limits worth knowing. The socket is pinned to the pool's primary seat rather than routed: the upgrade carries none of the headers session affinity keys on, so there is nothing to be sticky about, and scattering voice sockets across seats that have nothing to do with the session doing the talking would only be confusing. And with `--egress-proxy` set, dario **declines** the upgrade instead of relaying it — the relay dials with `node:https`, which the egress wrapper does not cover, and silently sending one socket direct while everything else tunnels is worse than saying no.

---

## Staying current: dario tracks a moving target

Claude Code's request shape changes between releases — new betas, tool renames, per-model thinking configs — usually with no subscriber-facing note. dario doesn't *guess* that shape: it captures it live from your own installed `claude` binary on every startup, diffs it against each upstream release, and replays it byte-for-byte. That's why your subscription routes the same through dario as it does through Claude Code itself — the request that leaves your machine *is* the shape your plan expects. Details: [`docs/wire-fidelity.md`](./docs/wire-fidelity.md) · [#13](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/13) · [#14](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/14).

Keeping that current is the whole job, and it's automated. Three watchers run unattended:

- **npm-release drift** — [`cc-drift-watch.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-watch.yml) catches each new Claude Code npm release; [`cc-drift-auto-release.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-auto-release.yml) auto-drafts, merges, and ships within minutes.
- **Same-binary remote-config drift** — [`cc-drift-template-watch.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-drift-template-watch.yml) runs on a self-hosted runner with a live Claude session (the only place this class is visible) and opens an auto-rebake PR with the diff inline. Anthropic ships changes through Claude Code's *remote config*, not just npm.
- **Rate-map drift** — [`cc-billing-classifier-canary.yml`](./.github/workflows/cc-billing-classifier-canary.yml) sends one live request a day and asserts the response still bills to a subscription bucket.

Guarded by a PR-time compat gate that runs the full suite against a live proxy before any wire-shape change merges, and a liveness alarm if a watcher goes quiet. A few recent changes the watchers caught and shipped fixes for, same-day:

| Change (no subscriber-facing note) | Effect | dario shipped |
|---|---|---|
| `context-1m` dropped from the default beta set on the OAuth path | Subscription requests default to the 200K window on Sonnet/Opus | v3.38.3–4 |
| `thinking: {type:"adaptive"}` gated per-model server-side | Sonnet/Opus 4-5 400 every request through any proxy | [v3.38.5](https://github.com/askalf/dario/pull/273) |
| Per-model `anthropic-beta` sets (opus 10, sonnet 9, haiku 6 — they track the baked base, so counts shift when CC's set does) | Proxies sending one set diverge for non-opus models | [v4.8.53](https://github.com/askalf/dario/pull/478) |

The full ledger lives in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md). Setup + walkthrough: [`docs/drift-monitor.md`](./docs/drift-monitor.md). Residual manual cases — OAuth rotation, runner re-registration — are in the [recovery runbook](./docs/recovery.md).

---

## The billing split — a contingency dario is built for

On **2026-05-13** Anthropic [announced](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan) that, from 2026-06-15, Agent-SDK and `claude -p` (headless) traffic would leave the subscription pool for a small separate monthly credit ($20 / $100 / $200 by plan), then metered API rates. **They paused it before that date** — those surfaces still bill subscription today, and Anthropic says it will give advance notice before any revised version. Nothing changed; no credits were issued.

The split isn't live, but it was announced once on short notice and could return — so dario is built for it either way. Every request is rebuilt into interactive Claude Code shape before it leaves your machine (and, with `--stealth`, the response-correlated timing an interactive session has), so your traffic sits in the subscription pool whether a split is paused or live. The [daily canary](#staying-current-dario-tracks-a-moving-target) is the tripwire: it surfaces a revived split within a day instead of on a surprise invoice. Verify on your own machine right now — `dario doctor --usage` fires one request and prints the rate-limit headers; `representative-claim` should read `five_hour` or `seven_day` (both subscription buckets). Full timeline: [`docs/why-now-2026-06.md`](./docs/why-now-2026-06.md).

## Capabilities

- **Multi-account pool.** Several Claude seats behind one endpoint, routed by per-model headroom with sticky-session cache locality and in-flight 429 failover. → [Multi-account pool](#multi-account-pool)
- **Local request diagnostics.** The Hits inspector and bounded FIFO debug log expose request previews, exact/semantic fingerprints, routing attempts, and cache/token accounting for diagnosing duplicate work and account skew. → [`docs/agent-diagnostics.md`](./docs/agent-diagnostics.md)
- **Byte-faithful passthrough for real Claude Code.** A genuine CC request already *is* the CC shape, so dario forwards it verbatim — system prompt, tools, thinking, key order untouched — keeping only its billing tag, identity, and cache breakpoints. Covers CC's whole family: the main loop, its Task/Agent sub-agents, and the permission classifier. Non-CC clients get the full template rebuild that keeps them routing. Background: [#678](https://github.com/askalf/dario/issues/678).
- **Headless admin API (`DARIO_ADMIN=1`).** Provision and manage pool accounts entirely over HTTP — start with zero accounts, `POST /admin/login/start`, paste the code back, routable the moment the `200` lands (live hot-reload, no restart). Token-gated even on loopback, audit-logged, rate-limited. Built for Docker / k8s / Pi. → [`docs/admin-api.md`](./docs/admin-api.md)
- **Runs any agent.** A 64-entry schema-verified `TOOL_MAP` pre-maps Cline, Roo, Kilo, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Copilot, OpenHands, OpenClaw, Hermes, and [hands](https://github.com/askalf/hands) tool names to CC's native set — no flag, no validator errors. MCP tools (`mcp__server__tool`) forward verbatim. [Compatibility matrix](./docs/integrations/compat-matrix.md) · [agent-compat.md](./docs/integrations/agent-compat.md).
- **Behavioral stealth (`--stealth`).** Adds *when* a request arrives to *what* it looks like — response-length-correlated think time and session-start latency. → [`docs/wire-fidelity.md`](./docs/wire-fidelity.md)
- **Voice dictation through dario (`VOICE_STREAM_BASE_URL`).** CC's `/voice` socket does not follow `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` — it goes straight to Anthropic carrying your own OAuth token, whatever your proxy is set to. Point it at dario and the socket gets a pool credential instead. → [Voice dictation](#voice-dictation)
- **VPN / egress routing.** Route dario's upstream traffic through a VPN or SOCKS5 proxy without putting the whole host on one. → [`docs/vpn-routing.md`](./docs/vpn-routing.md)
- **Run it as a service.** User-scope systemd unit, installed and removed by one script. → [`docs/systemd.md`](./docs/systemd.md)
- **Recover output (`--system-prompt=partial`).** Strips CC's tone/verbosity constraints for 1.2–2.8× more output on open-ended work, without changing which pool you bill to. [#183](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/183) · [`docs/system-prompt.md`](./docs/system-prompt.md)
- **Client-shape overrides.** `--honor-client-thinking` passes a client's own `thinking` block through unchanged; `--preserve-output-format` carries a client's `output_config.format` JSON schema through so structured-output SDKs (e.g. the Vercel AI SDK's `generateObject`) get schema-constrained output. Both off by default.
- **Reachable from inside CC / any MCP client.** `dario subagent install` registers a CC sub-agent for in-session diagnostics; `dario mcp` exposes dario as a read-only MCP server. → [`docs/sub-agent.md`](./docs/sub-agent.md) · [`docs/mcp-server.md`](./docs/mcp-server.md)

## Honest about what this is

dario uses your own subscription credentials, authenticates you as you, and impersonates nobody. What it changes is the **client** — it rebuilds each request into the exact shape Claude Code emits (captured live from your installed binary) so your plan routes the same no matter which tool actually sent it. Be clear-eyed on both sides of that: it's a transparency tool, in that it documents request behavior Anthropic doesn't publish for subscribers — and it's also, plainly, running through your subscription traffic that Anthropic's own tools bill differently. Both are true. dario is unofficial and unaffiliated ([DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md)); decide with both in view.

The most common question about dario, and it deserves a straight answer: **I can't promise you won't be actioned, and I'd be skeptical of anyone who does.** Only Anthropic decides how it enforces its terms. What I can do is lay out exactly how dario works, so you can weigh the risk yourself instead of taking anyone's word for it.

**What dario does:**

- **Runs entirely on your machine.** Your subscription token never touches my servers or anyone else's — requests go straight from your computer to Anthropic.
- **Authenticates as you, with your own Claude login** — the same OAuth credential Claude Code itself uses. It impersonates nobody and shares nothing.
- **Doesn't modify your account, billing, or subscription settings.**
- **Sends requests in the shape the official client sends them** — rebuilt from your own installed binary, not spoofed from a hardcoded fake.
- **Reports nothing, anywhere.** No telemetry, no analytics, nothing phones home — [verifiable in the source](#trust--transparency), which is the point of keeping it auditable in an afternoon.

**What dario does that Claude Code doesn't:** it lets tools *other than* Claude Code use that subscription. That's the whole point of it, and it's also the part that sits outside what Anthropic's own client does. Whether that falls within your plan's terms is Anthropic's call, not mine — read [their terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms), read [DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md), and decide deliberately.

**On policy risk specifically:** Anthropic's position on third-party clients has moved before and can move again. dario is built to surface that fast rather than paper over it — see [The billing split](#the-billing-split--a-contingency-dario-is-built-for) for the contingency already in place and the daily canary watching for it.

## Who it's for

**Best fit:** developers juggling multiple LLM tools and per-tool API keys · Claude Pro/Max subscribers who want their plan usable everywhere, not just in Claude Code · teams running local/hosted OpenAI-compat servers who want one stable local endpoint · Agent SDK users who want subscription routing with zero code change (`baseURL: 'http://localhost:3456'`) · power users wanting multi-account pooling + 429 failover.

**Not a fit:** you need vendor-managed production SLAs (use the provider APIs) · you want a hosted multi-tenant team platform with dashboards / SSO (dario is a single-owner local proxy) · you want a chat UI (use claude.ai).

## FAQ

**Does this violate Anthropic's terms?**
Mechanically, dario uses your existing Claude Code OAuth tokens — it authenticates you as you, with your subscription, through Anthropic's official endpoints. Whether any particular use complies with current terms is between you and Anthropic; consult their terms and your agreement. Independent, unofficial, third-party — see [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md). On the suspension question specifically: [Will my account get suspended?](#will-my-account-get-suspended)

**Do I need Claude Code installed?**
Recommended, not required. With CC, `dario login` picks up credentials automatically and the template extractor reads your binary on every startup. Without it, dario runs its own OAuth flow and falls back to the bundled (scrubbed) template snapshot.

**Do I need Bun?**
Optional, recommended — Bun's TLS ClientHello matches CC's runtime. Without it dario works fine; `dario doctor` flags the mismatch and `--strict-tls` hard-fails until resolved.

**Can I use dario without a Claude subscription?**
Yes. Skip `dario login`, run `dario backend add openai --key=…`, and you have a local OpenAI-compat router with no Claude involvement.

**`representative-claim: seven_day` in my headers — am I downgraded?**
No. `five_hour` and `seven_day` are both subscription billing — different accounting buckets, same mode. `overage` is the one that flips you to per-token. [#1](https://github.com/askalf/dario/discussions/1).

**Will the billing split break my setup?**
It was announced, then paused before it took effect — today nothing changed and your traffic still bills subscription. If it returns (Anthropic promised advance notice), dario already rewrites every request to interactive-CC shape, and the daily canary surfaces the change within a day. See [The billing split](#the-billing-split--a-contingency-dario-is-built-for).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Small TypeScript codebase, zero runtime deps. Architecture + file-by-file map in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/askalf/dario && cd dario
npm install
npm run dev    # tsx, no build step
npm test       # 125 suites in parallel via test/all.test.mjs
npm run e2e    # live proxy + OAuth (needs a working Claude backend)
```

Drift and audit runners, none of them part of `npm test`:

```bash
npm run drift:wire    # compare a live CC capture against the baked template
npm run drift:sdk     # Agent-SDK / Stainless pin drift
npm run audit:tui     # drives the real TUI through a fake TTY at 12 geometries
npm run check:overage # overage-classifier check against live headers
npm run stress        # concurrency / queue behaviour under load
npm run cch:calibrate # re-derive the billing-tag cch seed for a new CC build
```

Two easy ways to help beyond code: **star the repo** (the clearest signal this is useful), and **file drift** — open an issue when a rate-limit header flips or a tool that worked yesterday breaks today, and it gets documented in public alongside the fix. Follow [@ask_alf](https://x.com/ask_alf) for drift bulletins as they land.
