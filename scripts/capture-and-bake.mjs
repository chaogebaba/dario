/**
 * Capture a fresh template from the user's installed CC, scrub it, and
 * write it to `src/cc-template-data.json` as the bundled fallback.
 *
 * Only run this from the dario repo on a maintainer's own machine — the
 * scrubber strips host-identifying data before bake, but the raw capture
 * does pass through the capturing user's CC install.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run build          # the script imports from dist/
 *   node scripts/capture-and-bake.mjs              # capture + scrub + write
 *   node scripts/capture-and-bake.mjs --check      # capture + diff; exit 2 on shape drift, 3 on label-only drift, 0 on full match
 *   node scripts/capture-and-bake.mjs --allow-older-cc  # bypass the stale-binary guard (deliberate downgrade bake)
 *   node scripts/capture-and-bake.mjs --allow-missing-variant  # bypass the lock-step gate (ship a family with NO variant)
 *
 * The --check mode is non-destructive: it captures + scrubs but does not
 * write to disk. Useful from a scheduled cron (see docs/drift-monitor.md)
 * to detect same-binary remote-config drift — the class of change
 * documented in v4.2.1's CHANGELOG entry where CC's wire output shifts
 * within a single npm version. On non-zero exit, the wrapping cron / CI
 * step can open an issue or auto-PR a re-bake.
 *
 * Exits:
 *   0 — capture succeeded; in default mode wrote OUT; in --check mode, full match
 *       (wire shape AND _version label both current)
 *   1 — infrastructure failure (CC not on PATH, capture timeout, scrub failure,
 *       or installed CC OLDER than the bundle's capture — stale runner; an older
 *       binary re-captures yesterday's wire shape and would report it as drift,
 *       which reached the ship gate as a template downgrade in PR #632. Bypass
 *       for a deliberate downgrade bake with --allow-older-cc. Also: a
 *       VARIANT_FAMILIES capture failed with no previous variant to keep —
 *       shipping would silently serve that family the base prompt, and in
 *       --check the absence would masquerade as variant drift. Bypass with
 *       --allow-missing-variant)
 *   2 — --check mode only: wire-SHAPE drift vs current OUT (tools / system_prompt /
 *       beta / field order changed — needs a real re-bake; human-reviewed)
 *   3 — --check mode only: LABEL-only drift — wire shape matches but the bundled
 *       `_version` lags the live CC version. computeDrift ignores `_version` (its
 *       job is within-version shape drift), so this slips past exit 2, yet
 *       sdk-drift-watch.yml flags it against npm. Distinct code so the workflow
 *       can ship a deterministic label bump (scripts/label-sync.mjs) instead of
 *       waiting for a shape rebake to happen to ride along. On exit 3 the live
 *       version is written to `label-target.txt` for the workflow to consume.
