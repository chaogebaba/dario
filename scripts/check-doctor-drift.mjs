// BUILDOUT-06 — dario doctor drift check.
//
// Runs `docker exec askalf-dario dario doctor --obedience`, parses its status
// rows, and reports the runtime drifts NO other watcher catches:
//   - OAuth not [OK]        -> the deployed bearer/refresh is dead or expiring;
//                              dario 401s every non-Haiku call until re-authed
//                              (the recurring identity-drift time-sink).
//   - Template "live capture" -> the stale ~/.dario/cc-template.live.json is
//                              shadowing the bundled template (no CC binary in
//                              the container to refresh it).
//   - Identity [WARN]       -> OAuth-bearer/userID mismatch. doctor only detects
//                              this in POOL mode; single-account reads identity
//                              live per-request so it shows as [INFO] (not drift).
//   - Obedience [FAIL]      -> a model family answered a probe but ignored the
//                              client system prompt (dario#509 — the 2026-06-12
//                              sonnet regression class). Behavioral and
//                              upstream-influenced: a failure means "investigate
//                              the system-prompt presentation/merge", not
//                              necessarily "dario bug". Obedience [WARN] rows
//                              (probe couldn't complete) are infra flakes, NOT
//                              drift — they don't file issues.
//
// Complements cc-drift-watch (CC binary), cc-drift-template-watch (template
// bake) and sdk-drift-watch (npm pins) — none look at the live OAuth / runtime
// cache state, and none assert the models actually FOLLOW client system
// instructions. Detection only; no auto-fix.
//
// A deployed dario predating --obedience ignores the flag (unknown doctor args
// are no-ops) and emits no Obedience rows — that parses as clean for the
// obedience axis, so this script can ship ahead of the container image.
//
// stdout: a JSON report. Exit 1 = drift, 0 = clean, 3 = doctor could not run or
// its output was unparseable (infra/format error — the workflow surfaces red,
// NOT a false drift issue). Mirrors scripts/check-sdk-drift.mjs's contract.
