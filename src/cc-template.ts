/**
 * Detect text-tool-protocol clients (Cline, Kilo Code, Roo Code and
 * their forks) by fingerprinting the incoming system prompt.
 *
 * These clients ship their own XML-style tool invocation protocol in
 * the system prompt (`<execute_command>`, `<replace_in_file>`,
 * `<attempt_completion>`, …) and parse the model's output with a
 * regex tuned to that exact shape. When dario's default mode
 * substitutes CC's canonical tools into the `tools` array, the model
 * correctly emits Anthropic's generic `<function_calls><invoke>`
 * wrapper — which is well-formed for a CC-tool request but
 * unparseable for a text-protocol client, so every edit surfaces as
 * an error in the client UI even though the model produced a valid
 * response (dario#40, reported by @ringge).
 *
 * The fix is preserve-tools behavior: skip the CC tool swap so the
 * model sees the client's own schema and emits its native XML shape.
 * Auto-detection saves users from having to discover the
 * `--preserve-tools` flag exists; the flag is still honored as an
 * explicit override and `--hybrid-tools` outranks detection.
 *
 * Detection must run BEFORE `scrubFrameworkIdentifiers` so brand
 * names like "Cline" / "Roo" are still present. Tool-protocol
 * markers are scrub-proof on their own.
 *
 * Returns the matched family (`cline` / `kilo` / `roo` / `cline-like` /
 * `hermes`) or null when no signature is present.
 *
 * Hermes Agent (Nous Research) is a different case from the Cline family —
 * it uses the standard Anthropic JSON tool-use protocol (not XML). But it
 * ships ~40 tools, 15+ of which have no CC equivalent (browser_*, vision_*,
 * image_generate, text_to_speech, skills_*, memory, session_search,
 * cronjob, send_message, ha_*, mixture_of_agents, delegate_task, …). In
 * default mode dario distributes unmapped tools onto random CC slots which
 * silently misroutes them. preserve-tools is the correct default for
 * Hermes for the same outcome as Cline (client's tool schema passes
 * through untouched) even though the reason is different. The function
 * conflates both cases because the downstream dispatch is identical.
 * Reported via @vmvarg4 on X after the v3.30.5 marketing push.

 * overlap with CC's.
 * Default-mode round-robin onto CC fallback slots silently corrupts
 * those calls (the client gets back a Glob/Read/Bash response shape
 * its own tool can't parse).
 *
 * Returns 'unknown-non-cc' for that case so buildCCRequest can flip
 * to preserve-tools — the only correct routing for a tool surface
 * dario doesn't understand. Unlike the identity-string detector, this
 * catches future clients we haven't added an explicit pattern for
 * (in-house agents, OpenClaw derivatives, etc.) without needing
 * per-client maintenance.
 *
 * Threshold reasoning:
 * - 100% foreign (ANY size, including 1-2 tools): unambiguously non-CC. A real
 *   CC client always carries Bash + Read (TOOL_MAP keys once lowercased) or its
 *   own native tools (CC_NATIVE_NAMES), so it can never present a fully-foreign
 *   surface; only a genuinely non-CC tool set can. This catches the small
 *   in-house clients the 3-tool rule below
 *   misses, e.g. forge inspection agents dispatched with just their capability
 *   floor ([memory_store, db_query]). Before this, those 2-tool surfaces fell
 *   under a len<3 guard and got round-robined onto CC fallback slots, which
 *   silently corrupts every call (the model upstream never sees the real tool).
 * - Mixed surface (some tools map): require 3+ tools AND ≥80% unmapped. The 80%
 *   leaves room for a non-CC client that legitimately reuses 1-2 of TOOL_MAP's
 *   bash/grep/read aliases; the 3-tool floor avoids mis-flagging a partial CC
 *   load (1-2 tools, some mapped) mid-handshake — those stay null and remap.

  // (TaskCreate / TaskGet / TaskList / TaskOutput / TaskStop / TaskUpdate).
  // The previous `todo_read`/`todo_write` → `TodoWrite` mappings now point
  // at a destination tool that no longer exists in the bundled or live
  // template, so the schema-contract test correctly fails for them.
  //
  // We drop the mappings rather than remap to Task* because the semantics
  // diverge: TodoWrite replaced an entire flat todo list per call; Task*
  // is single-task-by-ID. A `todo_write` → `TaskCreate` rewrite would

 * v2.1.209 under subscription OAuth, 2026-07-14 — dario#678; docs:
 * code.claude.com/docs/en/prompt-caching#cache-lifetime). The client's

 * instead of overwriting with the 5m default — deleting them forced every

 * DARIO_CACHE_TTL_1H=1 is the opposite override: force `ttl:'1h'` on every

 * emit the 1h stamp itself (an SDK/agent harness that only stamps bare 5m —
 * dario#678). The proxy adds the enabling `extended-cache-ttl-` beta to the

 * guardrail: 1h cache *writes* bill ~2× the 5m rate, so it only wins when

 *
 * Placement mirrors a live capture of CC v2.1.203 (dario#678):
 *
 *  - Tools carry NO breakpoint. Real CC sends its tool array unstamped —
 *    Anthropic renders tools -> system -> messages, so the system breakpoints
 *    already cache the tools prefix. Stamping the last tool (pre-4.8.142) both
 *    diverged from CC's wire shape and spent the fourth slot the conversation
 *    anchor below needs.
 *
 *  - The rolling breakpoint goes on the last USER message, not the last
 *    message. CC skips trailing role:"system" injections (agent-type updates
 *    etc.); stamping "the last message" meant any turn ending in one wrote no
 *    conversation entry at all, and the next request re-paid the entire
 *    history as fresh input.
 *
 *  - The previous user message is anchored too. Anthropic's cache lookup
 *    walks back at most ~20 content blocks from a breakpoint; one parallel-
 *    tool turn (N tool_use + N tool_result blocks) can exceed that alone, and
 *    the rolling breakpoint then can't reach the prior turn's entry — the
 *    whole conversation re-bills at cache-WRITE cost every fan-out turn,
 *    which is the dario#678 burn ("read every file" sessions draining the
 *    Max window ~10x faster than direct CC). The anchor sits exactly where
 *    the previous request's rolling breakpoint was, so the lookup hits it
 *    positionally with no walk-back.

/**
 * Does this request come from Claude Code itself?
 *
 * The positive signal is `system[0]` carrying the `x-anthropic-billing-header`
 * block: CC emits it on every request that has a system prompt at all, and
 * nothing else generates one.
 *
 * It used to also require `system[1]` to start with one of five known openers.
 * That coupled the predicate to a CC release: CC ships far more than five
 * system prompts, and enumerating them is not a maintainable discriminator.
 * The billing block already is one.
 *
 * That change was made on the belief that a custom `~/.claude/agents`
 * definition puts operator-authored text at `system[1]`. Recorded against
 * 2.1.239 with a deliberately hostile agent ("You are Roo, a meticulous
 * line-counting specialist"), it does not: the operator's prompt lands at
 * `system[2]` and `system[1]` stays one of three CC-authored lines — the CLI
 * line, the Agent SDK line, or the sub-agent's "…running within the Claude
 * Agent SDK". The conclusion survives the correction; an opener allowlist is
 * still a release coupling, and the recording is only one release.
 *
 * The negative signal stays. A wrapper client that replays CC's preamble while
 * declaring its own identity (Kilo, Cline, Roo, Hermes, arnie, hands) is not
 * CC, and its tool schemas diverge enough that the byte-faithful path would
 * corrupt the calls — which is the whole reason detectTextToolClient exists.
 *
 * `headers` are the SECOND positive signal, not a special case for the quota
 * probe. They started as one — the probe is the request with no `system` key:
 *
 *     POST /v1/messages?beta=true
 *     {"model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","max_tokens":1,
 *      "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"quota"}],"metadata":{…}}
 *
 * CC fires it to read the `anthropic-ratelimit-*` response headers for one
 * token of output. Without the header signal it failed the body test and got
 * the full template stapled on: 323 bytes became 28.5KB, `max_tokens` 1 became
 * 64000, and 55 tool schemas came along — measured against a real CC 2.1.236
 * capture.
 *
 * Consulting them only when `system` was absent left a version cliff. The
 * billing block is a private CC detail; nothing obliges a future release to
 * keep spelling it the same way, and the day it changes EVERY request fails
 * the body test with no second signal to catch it. Measured on a real 2.1.239
 * main-loop request by renaming that one header and re-running buildCCRequest:
 * the system prompt went 11,813 → 40,369 bytes, `max_tokens` 32000 → 64000,
 * `thinking` and `context_management` were dropped, top-level key order
 * changed, Artifact / RemoteTrigger / WaitForMcpServers disappeared, and all
 * 56 tools were remapped. Silently, on every turn.
 *
 * So: either signal is enough, and the foreign-client check vetoes both. The
 * veto is what keeps the header path honest — a wrapper that forges CC's
 * user-agent while shipping Cline's prompt is still not CC.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of the veto: detectNonCCByTools. Two or three attached
 * MCP servers push a real CC session past its 80% line (28/52 seen live), so
 * wiring it in here would invent the false negative this function exists to
 * avoid. Tool-surface routing stays where it is, below the passthrough branch.
 *
 * Callers with no headers to hand keep the body-only behaviour.

  //   sends is the truthful one, and it is the block this predicate keys on —
  //   recognising a client by a marker and then overwriting it is not
  //   passthrough.
  //
  //   Cache breakpoints. dario stripped every client stamp and re-placed its
  //   own: system's last two blocks here, the last two user turns in
  //   applyCcPromptCaching. On the capture that relocated CC's single

/**
 * Streaming reverse-mapper for SSE responses.
 *
 * The non-streaming reverse-map can rewrite tool_use input in one pass
 * because it sees the whole `input` object. SSE streaming arrives in
 * three phases per tool_use block:
 *
 *   content_block_start  → carries `tool_use.name` and `tool_use.input: {}`
 *   content_block_delta  → carries `input_json_delta.partial_json` chunks
 *                          that, concatenated, form the full input JSON
 *   content_block_stop   → end of the block
 *
 * To rewrite the parameter shape we need the FULL input, which only
 * exists at content_block_stop. So for tool_use blocks that need
 * translation, we:
 *
 *   1. Forward content_block_start with the rewritten name (so clients
 *      see their own tool name immediately and can start tracking it)
 *   2. Swallow content_block_delta events for that block, accumulating
 *      partial_json into a per-block buffer
 *   3. On content_block_stop, parse the accumulated input, apply
 *      translateBack, and emit ONE synthetic content_block_delta with
 *      the full translated input as a single partial_json string,
 *      followed by the original content_block_stop event
 *
 * Trade-off: clients that consume tool_use input as it streams (rare
 * but possible) will see the input arrive as a single chunk at the
 * end of the block instead of streaming character-by-character. For
 * tool_use that's acceptable — input is usually small (<1KB) and the
 * alternative is parameter-shape mismatch causing validation errors.
 *
 * For tool_use blocks that DON'T have a translateBack mapping (or
 * aren't in the reverseMap at all), the streaming mapper passes the
 * original SSE bytes through unchanged.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   const mapper = createStreamingReverseMapper(toolMap);
 *   for await (const chunk of upstream) res.write(mapper.feed(chunk));
 *   const tail = mapper.end();
 *   if (tail.length) res.write(tail);
