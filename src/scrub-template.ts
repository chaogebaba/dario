/**
 * Template scrubber — sanitize a captured TemplateData before baking it
 * into `src/cc-template-data.json`.
 *
 * The bundled template is consumed by every brand-new dario install on
 * its very first proxy request, before the background live capture has
 * had a chance to refresh the cache. Whatever user-identifying data sits
 * in the baked file reaches Anthropic on that first request — so baked
 * captures must never carry host-specific paths, usernames, or the
 * capturing user's MCP tool set.
 *
 * Scrubbing preserves fingerprint-sensitive fields verbatim:
 *   - `header_order`, `header_values`, `anthropic_beta` — wire-level
 *   - `tools[].name`, `tools[].input_schema` structure — CC canonical
 *
 * Scrubbing modifies user-identifying fields:
 *   - `system_prompt` — removes the sections CC populates with host-
 *     specific state (`# Environment`, `# auto memory`, `# claudeMd`,
 *     `# userEmail`, `# currentDate`, `# gitStatus`), then replaces any
 *     residual user-dir paths with a `user` placeholder
 *   - `agent_identity` — same path replacement as a defensive measure
 *   - `tools[].description` — same path replacement
 *   - `tools` — drops any tool whose name begins with `mcp__` (those are
 *     the capturing user's MCP server tools, not CC-canonical)
 *
 * Stripped sections return to the live capture on first refresh — the
 * baked fallback is only consumed by a brand-new install's very first
 * request, before the background refresh has had time to run.
 *
 * Idempotent: scrub(scrub(x)) === scrub(x).
