/**
 * Durable atomic file writes for credential persistence.
 *
 * Why this exists (dario#790): the pool refresh loop already writes rotated
 * tokens back to `~/.dario/accounts/<alias>.json` and `credentials.json` via
 * writeFile(tmp) + rename. But a plain rename only guarantees atomicity of the
 * *directory entry*, not that the file's data blocks — or the rename itself —
 * have reached stable storage. On an abrupt container recreate (`docker rm -f`
 * → SIGKILL, the autodeploy path), the page cache is discarded before the
 * kernel flushes, so a bind-mounted `~/.dario` reverts to the last *durably*
 * persisted content: the mint-time file. That is the observed "credentials
 * frozen at the mint ms stamp after 25h of successful in-memory refreshes"
 * failure — every recreate after >8h loads a rotated-away refresh token and
 * every request 401s.
 *
 * The fix: fsync the temp file's data before the rename, then fsync the parent
 * directory after the rename so the rename itself is durable. This is the
 * standard write-temp → fsync(file) → rename → fsync(dir) sequence.

 * survives power loss / SIGKILL.
 *
 * `mode` sets the temp file permissions (0o600 for credential files).
 *
 * On platforms/filesystems where a directory fsync isn't supported (some
 * Windows and network filesystems throw EINVAL/EPERM/ENOTSUP on fsync of a

 * atomic rename already covers the common Linux container case this targets,
